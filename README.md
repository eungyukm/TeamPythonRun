## Number Guessing Game
## Description
This is a simple number guessing gmae implemented in Python.
A random number between 1 an 10 is generated, and the player has three attempts to guess the correct number.
The game provides hints ('UP' or 'Down') after each incorrect guess.

Each 'Person' object includes attributes such as name, gender, age, and a randomly assigned number.
The gmae begins with a description and allows the player three chances to guess the number.
Hints ('UP' or 'DOWN') guide the player towards the correct answer.

## How to Play
1. Run the script in your Python environment.
2. Enter your name, gender, and age to create a 'Person' object.
3. The gmae will start automatically after diplaying the player's information.
4. Try to guess the random number within three attempts.
